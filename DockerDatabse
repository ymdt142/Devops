Let say we are running an web app application container and we want to store the data in the database.
For this we need to run mysql container to store the data and the webapp application container.

Next task is to connect them. Since each container is an isolated container, we need create a network between these container to 
connect them.

Ok lets forst create and mySQL container and run it.

    1.  docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e MY_SQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test@123 -e MYSQL_DATABSE=testdb -e MYSQL_USER=admin
        -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=admin --name mysql mysql:latest

this will pull mysql:latest and run it. Mysql runs in port 3306 so we gave it 3306, we can find more info in internet.
Now databse is running we need to run webappcontainer and pass the databse information. ALso we are giving the name to 
this container because in docker we want to send request between two container we can send it through container name.
THis container name is now the hostName.

Now lets run the webapp container
    2.  docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -e MYSQL_HOST=mysql -e MYSQL_USER=admin -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=admin -e MYSQL_DB=testdb --name flask-app flask-app:latest


we are passing these enviroment values as in the code it is fetching it to conntet it to databse.
See the code from here https://github.com/ymdt142/two-tier-flask-app/blob/master/app.py
Now fask-app will try to connect to mysql container but however it will fail. Now next step is to create a Network

Create Docker Network
    3.   docker network create -d bridge networkName
    4.   docker network -ls
Now network is created. But we still need to configure it for flas-app container and mysql container.
Here -d is the driver and not demone mode.
