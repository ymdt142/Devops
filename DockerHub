DockerHub command
      docker login  (login to dokerhub after this giver username and password)

PUSH IMAGE TO DOCKERHUB
To pushc images into dockerHub we need to have image name format ass username/imagename:tagName so to rekame a exitsting image as in this formate use
      docker tag ImageName:TagName UserName/ImageName:TagName      (this will create new image with name formate as userName/IamgeName:TagName which we can push in dockerHub)
then push the new Image
      docker push userName/ImageName:TagName         (pushes the image to docker hub)
to remove the docker images from system
      docker rmi imageID
RUNNING DOCKER IMAGES
      docker run imagename:imagetag
RUNING WEBAPP DOCKER IMAGES
      docker run -d -p HostPortNumber:ContainerPortNumber image:tagname   (-d is demon mode to run in background)
                                                                          ( -p is to port number)
                                                                          (HostPortNumber is the portnumber of the local computer
                                                                           containerPortNumber is the port number of the container
since application is running in the container 8000 port we need to map it with local pport by using ':')
      eg
      docker run -d -p 8000:8000 java-app:latest
